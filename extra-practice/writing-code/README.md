One of the most important things you have to do when solving these problems, try to not refer to your compiler or online resources until **AFTER** you write a solution and you check if it works. This will prepare you for interviews as well as future exams that you have to take in your program which may involve more CS class. If you do it before, you won't be confident when it comes down to the test.

### Example 1
Write a function that takes in an integer array and its length and returns the mean of the array. **Note** the integer array will **ONLY** contain nonnegative numbers. So for example, from the array `[0, 35, 17, 7, 20,10]`, the mean would be `14.833`. You can also use this as your base:
```c
float mean(int array[], int length){



}
```
### Example 2
Write a function that takes in an integer array and its length and returns the range of the array. So for example, from the array `[7, -2, 10, 2, 6, 9]`, we would return `12`. You can also use this as your base:
```c
int range(int array[], int length){



}
```


### Example 3
Write me a program that takes in a value `a` and a value `b` from a user. And using **pointers** you have to switch `a` and `b`. You are allowed to use any extra variables that you might need. You can also use this as your base:
```c
int swap(int a, int b){


}
```
